# Sales, Customer & Product Business Intelligence Analysis

## Overview
This project delivers a structured SQL-based analysis of the AdventureWorks dataset, a fictional bicycle manufacturer and retailer. It explores sales trends, customer behavior, and product performance using advanced SQL techniques — designed to extract actionable business insights from raw transactional data.

> Built to demonstrate real-world data analysis skills using SQL Server.

| 2 | How do cumulative sales and average price evolve year over year? | `08_cumulative_analysis.sql` |
| 3 | How many of our customers are VIP, Regular, or New based on spending and loyalty? | `10_data_segmentation.sql` |
| 4 | What does the complete behavioral and demographic profile of each customer look like? | `12_report_customers.sql` |
| 5 | Which countries show unusually high sales volume compared to their customer base size, indicating stronger purchasing intensity per market? | `06_ranking_analysis.sql` |
| 6 | Which product categories generate revenue disproportionately high relative to their representation in the product catalog? | `11_part_to_whole_analysis.sql` |

## Key SQL Techniques Used
- Window functions: `RANK()`, `LAG()`, `SUM() OVER()`, `AVG() OVER(PARTITION BY)`
- CTEs for modular and readable query design
- Date functions: `DATETRUNC()`, `DATEDIFF()`, `FORMAT()`
- Business logic via `CASE WHEN` for segmentation and classification
- Reusable reporting views (`CREATE VIEW`)

---

## How to Run
1. Restore the AdventureWorks database on SQL Server
2. Run scripts in order from `01` to `13`
3. Query the views in `12_report_customers.sql` and `13_report_products.sql` for consolidated reporting layers
